I work in the analysis and optimization of decentralized algorithms, making sure that both scalability and security goals, often at odds, are met. Another area of active work is adding the incentives layer (rewards, slashings, handling of reports) to decentralized protocols, to ensure that all dishonest behaviors are discouraged. Finally, I study multi-agent decision-making mechanisms such as committee elections, referenda, auctions, and general on-chain governance. In these processes, I work on properties such as proportional representation, transparency, strategy proofness, and participation encouragement.

**Areas of interest.** Complexity theory, approximation algorithms, algorithmic game theory, mechanism design, computational social choice, crypto economics, and governance. On a lesser level: consensus protocols, finality gadgets, inter-operability across blockchains, zero-knowledge proofs.

**Short bio.** I'm originally from Ecuador, where I studied a mathematics degree at [USFQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universidad_San_Francisco_de_Quito), graduating Cum Laude. In 2011 I completed a [master's program](http://algant.eu/index.php) in U. Leiden, Netherlands on number theory, with a thesis on threshold cryptography. In 2016 I finished a Ph.D. program at EPFL, Switzerland, in the [Discrete Optimization](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/disopt/) group under the supervision of Prof. Friedrich Eisenbrand. My focus was on approximation algorithms for problems in graph theory and computational geometry. From 2016 to 2018 I was a post-doctoral researcher at ETH Zurich, in the [Institute for Operations Research](https://math.ethz.ch/ifor/), where I worked on the extension complexity of combinatorial polytopes, and the limits of linear and integer programming. I joined the Web3 Foundation in 2019.
