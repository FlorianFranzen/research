I am a researcher and team lead at Web3 Foundation, where I work on a number of tasks:

* help design and coordinate W3F's research agenda
* drive our outreach activites such as publications, presentations, and tutorials 
* iniate and coordinate external academic collaborations
* work on research challenges of Polkadot such as interoperability, networking, and auctions
* help with a research project aiming at designing a privacy-enhancing messaging service for decentralized applications

**Research Areas**

* Blockchain technology topics, in particular, interoperability and networking
* Privacy-enhancing technologies, in particular, anonymous communication networks
* Online voting systems

**Short Bio**

Before joining W3F, I obtained my PhD in the Electronic Engineering from KU Leuven in the renowned Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography (COSIC) group, under the supervision of Prof. Claudia Diaz and co-supervision of Dr. Markulf Kohlweiss (University of Edinburgh), where I was also affiliated to imec. My PhD thesis was titled "Investigating and Improving Anonymous Communication Systems." I obtained my M.Sc. in Computer Science from Saarland University. During my masters studies I worked for two years as a part-time student assistant at DFKI (German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence) in the Secure Systems group, led by Dr. Werner Stephan, helping with verifying secure partitioning for the PikeOS operating system.
