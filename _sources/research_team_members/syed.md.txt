Seyed is a Web3 Foundation researcher writing the Polkadot Runtime Environment (PRE) specification. He is also researching some of PREâ€™s primitives to see if they can be improved or simplified and helping with the implementation of various Algebraic and cryptographic primitives.

**Short Bio**. As a mathematician studying for his PhD, Seyed focused on curve based cryptography, specifically geometric structures that offer richer mathematical properties than elliptic curves. He has studied and designed provably secure messaging protocols. He has been involved in the development of various network protocols, ML-based attack mitigation and analysis and distributed and cooperative network solutions.
